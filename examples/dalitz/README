This example of a Dalitz-plot fit is known to work with v0.2 of GooFit.
It does not work with (nor even compile against) versions prior to v0.2; 
it may or may not work with later versions. 

To compile, make the environment variable CUDALOCATION point to your CUDA install.
Edit the Makefile to make GOOFITDIR point to the base GooFit directory. Then do

gmake dalitz
dalitz dalitz_toyMC_000.txt

The output should be a Dalitz plot stored in the file datatzplot.png, 
and a MINUIT fit log, the fit parameters being the real and imaginary
parts of the amplitudes of the resonances.

DEMO code for the D+ -> KKK MIPAW analysis
To build the code, do

make dalitz_D3K_sig
./dalitz_D3K_sig FastMC_sigtoy_0.root

This executable is able to test the signal fit model by running the fit over 1M signal toy MC events saved in "FastMC_sigtoy_0.root".
